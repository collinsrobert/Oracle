#If your Linux boxes have suddenly become very slow, here’s a structured approach to diagnose and hopefully resolve the issue:

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Check System Load

Run:

```bash
uptime
top
htop  # if installed
```

#Look for:

#* High load average relative to CPU cores
#* CPU or memory bottlenecks
#* Zombie or stuck processes

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Investigate Memory and Swap Usage

```bash
free -h
vmstat 1 5
```

#Look for:

#* High memory usage
#* High swap usage (indicates RAM exhaustion)

#---

### 💽 Step 3: Check Disk I/O

```bash
iostat -xz 1 3  # install sysstat if not available
iotop           # for real-time per-process I/O
df -h           # check for full partitions
```

#Issues to spot:

#* High disk I/O wait time (`%iowait`)
#* Full disk partitions
#* Unresponsive or failing drives

---

### 🔌 Step 4: Check Network Load (if network-based slowness)

```bash
ifstat
nload
netstat -plant
```

Look for:

* Abnormally high bandwidth usage
* Many open or hanging network connections

---

### 🔥 Step 5: Look at Recent Changes or Logs

```bash
journalctl -xe
dmesg | tail
last
```

#Check for:

#* Hardware issues
#* Kernel panics or OOM (Out of Memory) kills
#* User or software changes

---

### 🐛 Step 6: Identify Hung or Misbehaving Processes

#Use:

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
```

#Look for:

#* Processes consuming unusual CPU or RAM
#* Services in a D or Z (uninterruptible sleep or zombie) state

---

### 🛠 Step 7: Hardware or Virtualization

#* If on VMs, check host node resource contention.
#* For physical servers: `smartctl` (from `smartmontools`) to check disk health.

```bash
smartctl -a /dev/sdX
```
